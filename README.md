## Description

A solar year, length of time it takes a planet to make one revolution around the sun, varies from planet to planet. The applicatin will convert a user's age(earth years) to their relative age on each planet listed below:

 * Mercury ( 1 Mercury year = .24 earth year)
 * Venus ( 1 Venus year = .62 Earth year)
 * Mars ( 1 Mars year = 1.88 Earth years)
 * Jupiter ( 1 year = 11.86 Earth years)

The application will also determine a user's life expectancy, and determine how many years they have left to live or how many years they have lived past their life expectancy. Where year(s) is solar years for each planet.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
